Nginx-Server-Config-Generator
=============================

A Javascript webpage to generate a server config for Nginx.

Fill out the form and click 'Submit'. The script then generates a server config file for use in either nginx.conf (as server{}) or in a virtual host file.

TODO:

* Make page pretty
* Anything else I think of/is suggested.

Feel free to add code/translations, and then make a pull request. I suggest you ask (by emailing [contact@ajs.pw](mailto:contact@ajs.pw)) before setting off on a wild adventure, because turning code down after umpteen hours of creation isn't nice.
